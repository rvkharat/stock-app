Indian Stocks Price Action & Predictor — GitHub + Render
========================================================

Overview
- Streamlit app that fetches Indian stock data (.NS tickers) via yfinance, computes technical indicators,
  shows fundamentals, detects simple price-action patterns, produces rule-based buy/sell signals,
  and includes an optional RandomForest next-day close predictor.
- This repository is prepared for deployment to Render from GitHub.

Files you should have in repo root
- app.py            -> main Streamlit app
- requirements.txt  -> pip dependencies
- .streamlit/config.toml -> Streamlit runtime config for headless server
- render.yaml (optional) -> example Render service config
- README.md

Important notes about Render
- Render runs your container on the public web and provides PORT environment variable. The start command
  uses that PORT.
- The filesystem on Render is ephemeral — files written to disk (e.g., trained models with joblib) may disappear
  if the instance restarts or is redeployed. Use cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.) for persistence.
- Long training tasks are allowed but will consume CPU and may increase startup time. Consider background jobs or
  external model training if needed.
- Set any secrets (API keys) in Render dashboard environment variables.

Step-by-step: push to GitHub and deploy to Render
1) Create a new GitHub repository (public or private) and clone it locally:
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   cd <repo-name>

2) Add the files above into the repo (app.py, requirements.txt, .streamlit/config.toml, README.md).
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Streamlit trading app"
   git push origin main

3) Sign in to Render (https://render.com) and click New -> Web Service.

4) Connect GitHub and choose the repository and branch (main).

5) Set the following Render service settings:
   - Environment: Python 3
   - Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Start Command: streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT --server.headless true --server.enableCORS false
   - Region/plan: choose as per your needs
   - Set environment variables if necessary (no required ones by default)

6) Create and deploy. Render will build and start your web service. Once deployed, the service URL
   (e.g., https://your-service.onrender.com) will show your Streamlit app.

7) Use the app in the browser, input NSE tickers (e.g., RELIANCE, TCS), tune model retraining, download CSV/model if needed.

Recommended improvements (next steps)
- Persist trained models to an object store (S3/GCS) and load them on startup.
- Add background worker to train models asynchronously (Celery / Render Cron or background worker).
- Add authentication (Streamlit-Authenticator or Render managed authentication) if you want restricted access.
- Replace yfinance fundamentals with a premium API for more reliable fundamentals.
- Add backtesting module (vectorized backtest) for validating rule-based signals before using real capital.

Security & Legal
- This is educational. Not financial advice. Validate any strategy with backtesting and paper trading before real capital.
- Protect any API keys via Render environment variables and never commit secrets to GitHub.

If you want, I can:
- Create the GitHub repo and push these files for you (I would need repo details and permission).
- Add S3 model persistence code and Render environment variable instructions for credentials.
